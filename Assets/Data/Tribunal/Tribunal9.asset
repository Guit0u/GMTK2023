    - "Right, let's get on with it. Near the crime scene, a broken photo caught our
      eye. We might not have been interested in this object, but it was one of the
      only broken ones in the room. It shows a broken photo of a younger Trechton
      and another young soldier, it seems.\r"

    - Maybe there was a struggle, or maybe the photo meant something to the killer.
      In any case, there are a few traces of blood, so the assailant must have cut
      himself breaking the object. Mrs. Trechton, do you have any idea what this
      photo meant to your father?

    - A souvenir of the army, no doubt. That was my father's favorite period. But
      I don't recognize the man in the photo.
