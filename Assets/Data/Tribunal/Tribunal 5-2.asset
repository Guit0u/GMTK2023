    - Our fathers were friends, then colleagues in a regiment when I was younger.
      I wear my father's regimental number around my neck.
    - But my father disappeared a long time ago, and I know it affected <c=r>Mr.
      Trechton<c> a lot. I didn't dare to visit him for a long time. I was afraid
      it would reopen old wounds.
    - <c=r>Mr. Trechton<c> does not posess anything that could have belonged to my
      father. I don't see how this word burdens me other than to remind me of his
      disappearance.
