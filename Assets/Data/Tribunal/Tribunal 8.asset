      eye. We might not have been interested in this object, but it was the only
      broken one in the room.\r"
    - "It shows a broken photo of a younger <c=r>Trechton<c> and another young soldier,
      it seems.\r"

    - Maybe there was a struggle, or maybe the photo meant something to the killer.
    - In any case, there are a few traces of blood, so the assailant must have cut
      himself breaking the object.
    - <c=b>Mrs. Trechton<c>, do you have any idea what this photo meant to your father?

    - A memento of the army, no doubt. That was my father's favorite period. But
