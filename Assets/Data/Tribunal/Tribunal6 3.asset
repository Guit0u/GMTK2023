    - It's true that our fathers had a long association when they were younger. They
      were friends, then colleagues in a regiment. I wear my father's regimental
      number around my neck.
    - He disappeared a long time ago, and I know it affected Mr. Trechton a lot.
      I didn't dare see him for a long time for fear of reopening old wounds.
    - To return to our case, however, Mr. Trechton has nothing that could have belonged
      to my father, and I don't see how this word burdens me other than to remind
      me of his disappearance.
