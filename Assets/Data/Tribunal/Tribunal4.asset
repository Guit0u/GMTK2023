    - Right, let's move on to the next piece of evidence. We found blood on the floor
      a few meters from the corpse, and everything suggests that it's the murderer's
      blood, spilled as a result of a struggle
    - 'We carried out an analysis and were able to determine that it was a type O-
      sample. We also know that only two of our suspects have an O- profile, Mr.
      Jeffords and Mrs. Trechton. Can you explain the presence of your blood at the
      crime scene, Mrs. Trechton?

    - I'll take that as a no. What about you, Mr. Jeffords? If it doesn't belong
      to Mrs Trechton, it must be your blood.
